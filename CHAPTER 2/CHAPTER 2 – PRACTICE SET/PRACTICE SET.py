# 1. Write a python program to add two numbers

a = 1

b = 5

print(a + b)

# 2. Write a python program to find remainder when a number is divided by z.

a = 37

b = 5

print("Remainder when a is divided by b is", a % b)

# 3. Check the type of variable assigned using input () function

a = input("Enter the value of a: ")

# 4. Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than
# ‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80

a = int(input("Enter number 1: "))
b = int(input("Enter number 2: "))

print("a is greater than b is", a>b)

# 5. Write a python program to find an average of two numbers entered by the user.

a = int(input("Enter number 1: "))
b = int(input("Enter number 2: "))


print("The average of these two number is", (a+b)/2)

# 6. Write a python program to calculate the square of a number entered by the user.

a = int(input("Enter your number: ")) 


print("The square of the number is", a**2)
print("The square of the number is", a*a)
# print("The square of the number is", a^2) # Incorrect for finding square of a number in Python
